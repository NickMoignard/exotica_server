The Problem:

 * Gentlemens Lounge's can have from 20 - 100 dancers working at once. Each dancer will perform multiple times throughout the night in a variety of locations around each venue.

 * Each night a roster for the dancers is created by the manager on paper. Currently the manager has to either handwrite copies of the original sheet or individually remind each dancer.

 * Rosters are created by hand throughout the night, as they are subject to change at very short notice due to girls giving private dances.

Solution:

 * Create a digital Roster stored in the cloud (Ruby on Rails : RESTFul JSON API) 
 * Display Roster on televisions throughout each venue ( Single View Webpage )
 * Give venue managers an iPad with an app to edit the roster ( iOS Application )
